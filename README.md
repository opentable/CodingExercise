Hi, and welcome to your OpenTable assignment.

The goal of this exercise is to test a bit your UIKit and architecture skills. Your task is do "our" job, and build our app's upcoming reservation view, also known as "dining mode" internally.
There are 2 aspects to this:

- first, the dining mode itself. This is a "card" oriented view of your upcoming reservation.
- second, the "dining mode banner". That's an apple music-like banner, that inserts itself above the tab bar, and can be interactively pulled

### Dining mode
This is a typical "mix and match" content driven screen, laying out "cards" vertically, where some of the content might not be available:

- First card lists the restaurant name, the reservation time, the party size, and includes a picture of the restaurant
- Second card lists the restaurant address, along with a map of the restaurant's address
- Third card is the "best dishes" feature: an optional list of 1 to 3 dishes, along with a review snippet, where mentions of the dish are emphasized. Some ground rules about dishes:
	* A dish is guaranteed to have at least one photo, and exactly one snippet
	* A snippet holds the full review, a range which indicates which part should be displayed, and a list of highlight ranges. All the ranges are relative to the full review (e.g. a highlight  at (197, 8) means "8 characters starting from the 197th character in the full review", regardless of which range of the review should be displayed).
	* if the restaurant has no dishes, the card should not be shown
	* if the restaurant has more than 3 dishes, only the first 3 should be shown
	* for each displayed snippet, we want to display: the photo, the dish name and the snippet along with its highlight. You're free to pick whatever method for the highlight (bold, color, underline etc.)

In real life, this screen has about 20 cards displayed, most of which have various states depending on the reservation (pre/during/post dining, reservation status, host vs invited guest, etc.). We want to be able to reorder some cards in an ab test, be able to easily tell which card shows where and when, or easily understand why a specific reservation isn't behaving as we'd expect.
Thus, the objective here is really to design for ease of modification/modification/debugging. Keep this in mind when design, even though the exercise only defines 3 cards, in real life, this would scale up to 20-ish, with complicated conditions depending on the current time, the reservation's time, who is logged in (or not logged in), and things like this.

Here's a sample GIF from our app (albeit, the older design): http://opentable.d.pr/tgCj/5ohCOmky

### Dining mode banner
This one is a persistent banner, Apple Music style.
A banner should be displayed above the tab bar, with details about the upcoming reservation (assuming there is one). Switching tabs or pushing a new view controller on a nav stack shouldn't affect the banner.
Tapping the banner should expand the banner into a the full screen dining mode implemented in the previous.

Here's a sample GIF from our current app: http://opentable.d.pr/aZ8Q/tdvdDsZ2. Ignore the dragging behavior in the GIF, we closed that can of worms a long time ago, and a non interactive transition is not only fine, but also preferrable.

### General Instructions:
- Focus on clarity, readability and maintanability of your code. We write our code once, but we read it many times over. Maintainability is more desirable feature that clever one liners.
- This isn't a visual design exercise, so you don't have to worry about that piece. Typically, if you want to set background colors to clearly differentiate the views when debugging, you can send your PR with those colors in.
- I've included GIFs from our own app, for inspiration, but you don't have to follow that visual design
- You'll find some code under Vendor/ â€“ I've put basic domain objects in there, a reference JSON file, and assembler code to build up the domain object from the JSON object.
- I do realize there's a *lot* in this exercise. If you can't wrap it all up (and you probably won't), prioritize things and let me know why you picked something over something else.
- I've included a binary distro of AFNetworking for the image download part, feel free to use it. Or you can stick with raw NSURLSessions if you're more comfortable with that.
